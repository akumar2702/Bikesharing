# Bikesharing

## Overview 
### The purpose of this analysis was to work with the CitiBikes data to determine how many people ride their bikes in NYC. We wanted to see the difference in the times of the day, the genders and the duration of the rides. We need this data to  get a better business proposal and make the most of it.

* This shows that most riders rode their bike for less than 10 mimutes.

## Summary
### This data shows that people love to ride their bikes when the weather is beautiful outside, not too cold and not too hot. The early mornings and the evenings are the best times because the weather is just right. Two more visuals I would do is compare different months of bike riding and seeing how many people bike for pleasure compared to for work.
